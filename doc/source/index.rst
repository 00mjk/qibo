QIBO is a Python library for classical simulation of
quantum algorithms. QIBO provides a standard interface for the implementation and extension of quantum algorithms in double precision. Simulation takes full advantage of hardware accelerators such as GPU and CPU with multi-threading support. The package includes a multi-GPU distributed approach for circuit simulation.
