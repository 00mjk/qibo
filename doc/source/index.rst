QIBO is a Python library for classical simulation of
quantum algorithms.

Some of the key features of QIBO are:

      - A standard interface for the implementation and extension of quantum algorithms.
      - Modular implementation on GPU and CPU with multi-threading support.
      - Availability of multi-GPU distributed approach for circuit simulation.
      - Full support of double precision simulation.
