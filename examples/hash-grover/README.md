## Introduction

Grover's Algorithm is an example of the advantages a quantum computer has over a classical computer in the task of searching databases. This program applies a Grover search on a brute force check of preimages for a Toy Sponge Hash construction.

## Grover's search algorithm

The algorithm proposed by Grover [arXiv:quant-ph/9605043](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9605043) achieves a quadratic speed-up on a brute-force search of this preimage finding problem.

This program builds the necessary parts of the algorithm in order to simulate this algorithm. Crucially, Grover's algorithm requires an oracle that is problem dependent, which changes the sign of the solution of the problem.

### Oracle

(work in progress)

### Diffusion transform

After the sign change of the solution states, an inversion about average amplifies their amplitude. This is at the core of Grover's search algorithm. This operator, also known as Diffusion transform, can be constructed by a set of Hadamard gates on all qubits, a multi-qubit gate that changes the sign of the |0000...00> state, and another set of H gates.

### Building the algorithm

The quantum register is started with Hadamard gates on all qubits encoding the problem, and an X gate followed by a Hadamard gate on the Grover ancilla, used to change the sign of the solution.

Should the total number of preimages be known, the oracle and diffusion transform are applied (Ï€/4)sqrt(N/M) times, where N is the total number of possible outcomes and M is the number of preimages.

If that is not the case, the code follows the algorithm put forward in [arXiv:quant-ph/9605034](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9605034).

The quantum circuit for the Grover search algorithm with any oracle takes the form:

## How to run the example?

Run the file `main.py` from the console to find a preimage for hash value '10100011' (163) using 18 qubits.

Changing the argument `--hash` (int) allows find preimages of different hash values.

Changing the argument `--bits` (int) allows to fine tune the maximum number of bits of the hash function. If less than needed, the minimum amount of bits required will be used.

Should the number of preimages be known, please add them in `--collisions` (int), which is set to `None` by default. 

Some examples for hash values with known collisions:

- 187 (1 collision)
- 163 (2 collisions)
- 133 (3 collisions)
- 113 (4 collisions)

The program returns:

- If a solution has been found and the value of the preimage.
- Total number of function calls required.

The functions used in this example, including gate by gate decompositions of both the oracle and diffusion transform are included in `functions.py`.
